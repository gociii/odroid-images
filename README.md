# odroid-images

This is a repository holding images built primarily for the odroid-u3 & odroid-u3+ SBCs (single-board computers), that sport a Samsung Exynos processor. These SBCs who were manufactured by Hardkernel, and are no longer in production and are no longer supported.

**BE CAREFUL!** 

Although the Odroid U2 and U3 are similar SBCs, they have some differences in hardware specifications. The U3 has a faster CPU (1.7 GHz quad-core) than the U2 (1.7 GHz dual-core), and it also has some additional features such as Gigabit Ethernet and a USB 3.0 port. As a result, images built specifically for the **Odroid U3 may not be fully compatible with the Odroid U2.** 

The differences in hardware may cause some drivers and software components to behave differently or not work at all. That being said, some software images may be compatible with both the U2 and U3 if they are designed to be flexible and work across multiple similar hardware configurations. It ultimately depends on the specific image and how it was built and tested.


If you're looking for an image to run on your Odroid U2, it's recommended to look for images specifically built for the U2 or for a similar hardware configuration to ensure the best compatibility and performance.


_All images in this repository are tested by the maintainer on odroid-u3 & odroid-u3+ ONLY. However, please note that this code is provided as-is and without warranty. Use at your own risk._
